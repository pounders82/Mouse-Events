## General info
This project is a simple application that I created in order to practice the concepts of JavaFx. This program displays two circles that are attached by a line. The distance in pixels is displayed above the line. The user can click and drag either of the circles to move them. The line that connects the circles moves with the circle being dragged and the distance is also updated while the circle is being dragged.
